Background

Create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using d3, html and js the dashboard includes a bubble graph, a bar chart and a summary table linked with a dropdown menu.
